## Cloud Research 
### 1. Introduction to cloud computing (aws academy : Module 1 - Cloud Concepts Overview)

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database, storage, applications, and other IT resources via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

### 2. Traditional computing and Cloud computing (aws academy : Module 1 - Cloud Concepts Overview)

- traditional computing
In the traditional computing model, infrastructure is thought of as hardware. Hardware solutions are physical, which means they require space, staff, physical security, planning, and capital expenditure. 
- cloud computing 
By contrast, cloud computing enables you to think of your infrastructure as software. Software solutions are flexible. You can select the cloud services that best match your needs, provision and terminate those resources on-demand, and pay for what you use. 

### 3.  Advantages of using cloud computing (aws academy : Module 1 - Cloud Concepts Overview) & (Course on Udemmy - AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Slides : slide 22)

• Trade capital expense (CAPEX) for operational expense (OPEX)

• Benefit from massive economies of scale

• Stop guessing capacity

• Increase speed and agility

• Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers

• Go global in minutes

### 4. Type of cloud computing (aws academy : Module 1 - Cloud Concepts Overview) & (Course on Udemmy - AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Slides : slide 25-26)

• Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

• Platform as a Service (PaaS)

• Software as a Service (SaaS)



### 5. Pricing of the Cloud (aws academy : Module 2 - Cloud Economics and Billing) & (Course on Udemmy - AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Slides : slide 27)

Three fundamental drivers of cost with AWS :

• Compute -> Pay for compute time

• Storage -> Pay for data stored in the Cloud

• Data Transfer -> Data transfer IN is free

### 6. AWS Global Infrastructure (aws academy :  Module 3 - AWS Global Infrastructure Overview) & (Course on Udemmy - AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Slides : slide 31-36)

• AWS region 

• AWS Availability Zones

• AWS Data Centers

• AWS Edge Locations / Points of Presence
