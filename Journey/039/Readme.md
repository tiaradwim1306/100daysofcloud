# Well Architected Framework & AWS Cloud Best Practices : Course on Udemmy by Stepahane Mareek

## Cloud Research
### Well Architected Framework - General Guiding Principles 
- Stop guessing your capacity needs 
- Test systems at production scale 
- Automate to make architectural experimentation easier 
- Allow for evolutionary architectures, design based on changing requirements 
- Drive architectures using data 
- Improve through game days, simulate applications for flash sale days

### AWS Cloud Best Practices – Design Principles
- Scalability: vertical & horizontal
- Disposable Resources: servers should be disposable & easily configured
- Automation: Serverless, Infrastructure as a Service, Auto Scaling…
- Loose Coupling:
	- Monolith are applications that do more and more over time, become bigger
	- Break it down into smaller, loosely coupled components
	- A change or a failure in one component should not cascade to other components
- Services, not Servers:
	- Don’t use just EC2
	- Use managed services, databases, serverless, etc !
