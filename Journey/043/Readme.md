### AWS Right Sizing
- EC2 has many instance types, but choosing the most powerful instance type isn’t the best choice, because the cloud is elastic
- Right sizing is the process of matching instance types and sizes to your workload performance and capacity requirements at the lowest possible cost
- Scaling up is easy so always start small
- It’s also the process of looking at deployed instances and identifying opportunities to eliminate or downsize without compromising capacity or other requirements, which results in lower costs
