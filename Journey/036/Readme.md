# AWS IoT, Elastic Transcoder, AppSync, Amplify, AWS Device Farm : Course on Udemmy by Stepahane Mareek


## Cloud Research
### AWS IoT (Internet of Things)
IoT is a network of internet-connected devices capable of collecting and transferring data that allows you to easily connect IoT devices to the AWS Cloud
- Serverless, secure & scalable to billions of devices and trillions of messages
- Your applications can communicate with your devices even when they aren’t connected
- Integrates with a lot of AWS services (Lambda, S3, SageMaker, etc.)
- Build IoT applications that gather, process, analyze, and act on data

### Amazon Elastic Transcoder
Elastic Transcoder is used to convert media files stored in S3 into media files in the formats required by consumer playback devices (smartphones, tablets, etc..)

Benefits:
- Easy to use
- Highly scalable, can handle large volumes of media files and large file sizes
- Cost effective, duration-based pricing model
- Fully managed & secure, pay for what you use


### AWS AppSync
- Store and sync data across mobile and web apps in real-time
- Makes use of GraphQL (mobile technology from Facebook)  for client Code can be generated automatically
- Integrations with DynamoDB / Lambda
- Real-time subscriptions so you can offline data synchronization (replaces Cognito Sync)
- Fine Grained Security
- AWS Amplify can leverage AWS AppSync in the background!

### AWS Amplify 
- A set of tools and services that helps you develop and deploy scalable full stack web and mobile applications
- Authentication, Storage, API (REST, GraphQL), CI/CD, PubSub, Analytics,AI/ML Predictions, Monitoring, Source Code from AWS, GitHub, etc…

### AWS Device Farm
- Fully-managed service that tests your web and mobile apps against desktop browsers, real mobile devices, and tablets
- Run tests concurrently on multiple devices (speed up execution)
- Ability to configure device settings (GPS, language, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, …)
