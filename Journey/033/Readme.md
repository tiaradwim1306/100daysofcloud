# AWS STS and Amazon Cognito : Course on Udemmy by Stepahane Mareek

## Cloud Research 
### AWS STS (Security Token Service)
- Enables you to create temporary, limited- privileges credentials to access your AWS resources
- Short-term credentials: you configure expiration period

Use cases
- Identity federation: manage user identities in external systems, and provide them with STS tokens to access AWS resources
- IAM Roles for cross/same account access
- IAM Roles for Amazon EC2: provide temporary credentials for EC2 instances to access AWS resources

### Amazon Cognito (simplified)
- Identity for your Web and Mobile applications users (potentially millions)
- Instead of creating them an IAM user, you create a user in Cognito
