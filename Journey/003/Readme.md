## Cloud Research
### IAM - Identity and Access Management
- IAM is Global Service 
- root created by default and u shouldn't be used and shared 
- IAM = Identity and Access Management, Global service
- Users are people within your organization, and can be grouped
- Groups only contain users, not other groups
- Users don’t have to belong to a group, and user can belong to multiple groups

#### practice : create a user, create a group, enter the user into the group and test it.


### Permissions 
- Users or Groups can be assigned JSON documents called policies
- These policies define the permissions of the users
- In AWS you apply the least privilege principle: don’t give more permissions than a user needs 

### IAM Policies 
- Consists of version,id and statement
- statement contain of Sid,effect,principal,action,resource,and condition 

### Password Policy 
- strong password 
- setup password policy : 

>  • Set a minimum password length
>
>  • Require specific character types
>
>  • Allow all IAM users to change their own passwords
>
>  • Require users to change their password after some time (password expiration)
>
>  • Prevent password re-use
